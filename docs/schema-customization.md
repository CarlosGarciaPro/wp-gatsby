# WPGraphQL Schema Modification

WPGatsby makes some customizations to the WPGraphQL Schema to allow Gatsby Source WordPress to work
more efficiently. 

@todo: need to document what is added to the WPGraphQL Schema and why. Ex:

- `isWpGatsby`
- `wpGatsby`
- `wpGatsbyCompatibility`
- `actionMonitorActions`
